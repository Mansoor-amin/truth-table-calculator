    <h1>Computer Types</h1>
    <p>Computer types according to capability are</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Supercomputers</li>
        <li>MainframesServers</li>
        <li>Servers</li>
        <li>Desktops</li>
        <li>Portables</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Supercomputers</h2>
    <p>
        State-of-the-art machines designed to perform calculations as fast as the current technology allows
Used to solve extremely complex and large-scale problems: weather prediction, simulation of atomic explosions; aircraft design; movie animation
Cost tens of millions of dollars
Unique in that unlike mainframes & personal computers, designed to focus all their resources and capabilities on a single task at a time
Early supercomputers used a single or a few processors working in parallel
Those processors were custom-built for the supercomputers, and were, therefore, very expensive
Modern supercomputers use the same processors that are used in desktop PCs. They, however, are designed to use 1000’s of them working together in parallel
    </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Mainframe Computers</h2>
    <p>Also called “Enterprise Servers”
Designed for performing multiple, intensive tasks for multiple users simultaneously
Used by large businesses (e.g. banks, e-commerce sites), military, and industrial organizations
Designed for very-high reliability
Can be serviced/upgraded while in operation
Generally consist of multiple processors, GB’s of memory, and TB’s of storage
Cost in millions of dollars</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Servers/Minicomputers</h2>
    <p> The name minicomputers used to define the class of computers that lies between personal computers and mainframes
Then very high-end desktop computers – called low-end or mid-range servers – took over the role that was previously played by minicomputers
Low-end and mid-range servers are used by small businesses and organizations as file-stores, to run e-mail systems and Web sites
Generally are more reliable than desktops, but not as solid as the mainframes
Generally consist of 2 or more processors, GB’s of memory, and TB’s of storage
Costs in hundreds of thousands of dollars</p></li>
        <li>
            <h2>Desktop Computers</h2>
    <p>Also called microcomputers
Low-end desktops are called PC’s and high-end ones “Workstations”
Generally consist of a single processor only, some times 2, along with MB’s of memory, and GB’s of storage
PC’s are used for running productivity applications, Web surfing, messaging
Workstations for more demanding tasks like low-end 3-D simulations and other engineering & scientific applications
Are not as reliable and fault-tolerant as servers
Workstations cost a few thousand dollars; PC around a $1000</p></li>
        <li>
            <h2>Mobile Computers</h2>
    <p>Laptops, palmtops, and wearable computers are very capable computers but are light-weight and consume very little power
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Laptops</h3>
        <p>also called notebook computers
generally weigh around 2kg
use special low-power processors
typically have 256MB memory,
40GB of storage
can work for more than 2 hours on battery.
Their usage is similar to that of PCs
They cost in the range of $1500-2500</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Palmtops</h3>
        <p>also known as PDA’s - Personal Digital Assistants
Weigh less than a pound
have very low-power processors
KB’s of memory
MB’s of storage capacity
Can run for many hours on AA batteries
Used as an electronic version of a pocket diary
Also for Web surfing and e-mail or even as mobile phones
Palmtops cost $200-600</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Wearable</h3>
        <p>are small in size
carried in a pocket
worn on the arm, waist
or head or elsewhere on the body
Capability similar to PDA’s
but more expensive
They are always ON, and always accessible. That is, the user can always enter and execute commands, even while walking around or doing other activities
Each soldier of the future will be fitted with one</p>
